### Note that this needs the "bind-client" and "ip" packages installed.

#### Configuration section (change here according to your server names)

## The name of the "WAN" interface
INTERFACE=wan
## The device used by the "WAN" interface
DEVICE=pppoe-wan
## Authoritative name server to update
NAMESERVER=ns.d.example.com.
## Zone to update
ZONENAME=d.example.com.
## Hostname to update
HOSTNAME=myrouter.${ZONENAME}
## Desired TTL (time-to-live), in seconds
TTL=60
## Key file
KEY=/root/Kmyrouter.d.example.com.+157+54658.key

#### Action section (no need to change anything below this line)

## Tag and facility under which messages are logged
tag="30-nsupdate[$$]"
facility=daemon

exec >>/tmp/foo.log 2>&1

[ "$INTERFACE" != "${INTERFACE}" ] && exit 0
[ "$ACTION" != "ifup" ] && [ "$ACTION" != "update" ] && exit 0

## This doesn't seem very necessary, because we run an NTP client.
## But maybe it is useful when booting the router after some time.
## NTP may take a while to converge.
#rdate -s time.nist.gov # rdate is not part of OpenWrt anymore.

. /lib/functions/network.sh
network_get_ipaddr ipaddr ${INTERFACE}
if [ -z "${ipaddr}" ]
then
  logger -t ${tag} -p ${facility}.warn "config_get did not find ipaddr, trying ip -4 addr show"
  ipaddr=`ip -4 addr show dev ${DEVICE} | grep inet | sed -e 's/.*inet \([.0-9]*\).*/\1/'`
fi

## Now we construct a DNS UPDATE packet and send it to the
## authoritative server.  We need to provide key material to authenticate.
echo "server $NAMESERVER
zone ${ZONENAME}
update delete ${HOSTNAME} IN A
update add ${HOSTNAME} ${TTL} IN A $ipaddr
send" | nsupdate -k ${KEY} -v || logger -t ${tag} -p ${facility}.error "Update $HOSTNAME IN A $ipaddr failed"
logger -t ${tag} -p ${facility}.info "Updated $HOSTNAME IN A $ipaddr"
